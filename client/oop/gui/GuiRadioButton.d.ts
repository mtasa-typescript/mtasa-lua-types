     * @param x A float of the 2D x position of the radio button on a players screen. This is affected by
     * the relative argument.
     * @param y A float of the 2D y position of the radio button on a players screen. This is affected by
     * the relative argument.
     * @param width A float of the width of the text field next to the radio button. This is affected by the
     * relative argument.
     * @param height A float of the height of the text field next to the radio button. This is affected by the
     * relative argument.
     * @param text The text to be displayed next to the radio button.
     * @param relative This is whether sizes and positioning are relative. If this is true, then all
     * x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing measures relative to the
     * parent.
     * @param parent This is the parent that the radio button is attached to. If the relative argument is
     * true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent. If the relative
     * argument is false, positioning will be the number of offset pixels from the parents
     * origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become the screen - causing positioning
     * and sizing according to screen positioning.
     * ''NOTE:'' All radio buttons become grouped together with their parent item.  Only ONE
     * radio button per group/parent will be able to be selected at the same time.
     * @return returns element of the radio button if it was created succesfully, false otherwise.
