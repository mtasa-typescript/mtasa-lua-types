     * @param relative This is whether sizes and positioning are relative. If this is true, then all
     * x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing measures relative to the
     * parent.
     * @param parent This is the parent that the image is attached to. If the relative argument is true, sizes
     * and positioning will be made relative to this parent. If the relative argument is false,
     * positioning will be the number of offset pixels from the parents origin. If no parent is
     * passed, the parent will become the screen - causing positioning and sizing according to
     * screen positioning.
     * @return returns element if image was created successfully, false otherwise.
