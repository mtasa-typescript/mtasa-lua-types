     * @param x A float of the 2D x position of the GUI tab panel on a players screen.  This is affected
     * by the relative argument.
     * @param y A float of the 2D y position of the GUI tab panel on a players screen. This is affected
     * by the relative argument.
     * @param width A float of the width of the GUI tab panel. This is affected by the relative argument.
     * @param height A float of the height of the GUI tab panel. This is affected by the relative argument.
     * @param relative This is whether sizes and positioning are relative.  If this is true, then all
     * x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing sizes relative to the
     * parent.
     * @param parent This is the parent that the tab panel is attached to.  If the relative argument is true,
     * sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent. If the relative argument is
     * false, positioning will be the number of offset pixels from the parents origin. If no
     * parent is passed, the parent will become the screen - causing positioning and sizing
     * according to screen positioning.
     * @return returns a gui tab panel element if successful, false otherwise.
