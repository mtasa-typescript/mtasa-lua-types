     * zero, failure is guaranteed.)

     * @param width The width of the texture in pixels.
     * @param height The height of the texture in pixels.

     * channels to black color
     * @return returns a texture element if successful, false if the system is unable to create a render
     * target.
     * you should always check to see if this function has returned false.
