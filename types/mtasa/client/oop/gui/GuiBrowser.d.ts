     * <br>The difference between this, and createBrowser is that, this handles inputs
     * internally, and it can be attached to GUI windows. So this one is more suitable for
     * custom dx based interfaces.
     * You can learn more about the differences

     * @see {@link https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/GuiCreateBrowser Wiki, guiCreateBrowser }
     * @param width The browsers native width. This should be greater than or equal to 1.
     * @param height The browsers native height. This should be greater than or equal to 1.
     * @param isLocal Sets whether the browser can only show local content or content from the internet (see
     * examples over CreateBrowser|here for more information)
     * @param isTransparent true if you want the browser to support transparency, false otherwise
     * @param isRelative This is whether sizes and positioning are relative.  If this is true, then all
     * x,y,width,height floats must be between 0 and 1, representing sizes/positions as a
     * fraction of the screen size. If false, then the size and co-ordinates are based on
     * clients resolution, accessible using guiGetScreenSize.
     * @param parent This is the parent that the radio button is attached to. If the relative argument is
     * true, sizes and positioning will be made relative to this parent. If the relative
     * argument is false, positioning will be the number of offset pixels from the parents
     * origin. If no parent is passed, the parent will become the screen - causing positioning
     * and sizing according to screen positioning.
     * @return returns a gui-browser element if it was created successfully, false otherwise. returns
     * also false, if the user disabled remote pages and islocal was set to false.
